# VaspGibbs

A simple way to get Gibbs free energy from Vasp calculations

## Installation

```
pip install vaspgibbs
```

*Latest version:* 0.2.0 (beta)

## Usage

In a folder with a finished vasp calculation, run
```
vasp_gibbs
```

`vasp_gibbs` will rerun Vasp to obtain vibration modes and output the gibbs free energy of your system.

Use `-o` (only) or `-t`(top) to specify a set of atoms for which to calculate vibration modes. Examples:

 * `-o C O` would only compute vibration modes associated with C and O keeping all other atoms fixed.
 * `-o 1 3 6` would compute vibration modes associated with the first, third and sixth atoms in the POSCAR keeping all other atoms fixed.
 * `-t 10` would compute vibration modes associated with the first 10 atoms starting from the top of the unit cell along the c axis.

This can be useful when computing free energy differences between systems where one part of the system does not change, e.g. adsorption free energies.

To run vasp in parallel call:
```
vasp_gibbs -n [number of proc] -m [mpi executable] -v [vasp executable]
```

By default `srun` and `vasp_std` are used.

VaspGibbs will automatically compute the moment of inertia and symmetry of your molecule and compute rotational and translational contributions if you specify that the system is a molecule with the `-m` flag.

The temperature and pressure can be set using the `-T` and `-P` flags.

## Under development

Results have been checked with [J. Phys. Chem. C 2013, 117, 49](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp407468t). More validation needs to be done; use with care.

*Next steps:* more testing, add to pypi, PV term for solids with Murnaghan equation, hindered translator and rotor?

Let me know if you would like new features to be added!
